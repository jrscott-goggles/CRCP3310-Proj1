# CRCP3310-Proj1
Visualization of Alice in Wonderland
The first project for CRCP 3310 Spring 2016, with the goal of learning how to parse and visualize unstructured data.  Basic objective is to create a visualization of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland using Java and Processing.

Requirements:
1.) Each letter should be represented by a specific color.
2.) "Alice" should be highlighted as well.
3.) Non-alphabetic characters should be the same color.
4.) The number of times "Alice" appears in the text should be noted.
5.) When a user clicks on the screen, the program should display the frequency of each character in the text.  The most and least frequent character should be specified.
6.) The input data must be treated as a stream using java.io.BufferedReader.
